## Online Development

You can open a development environment in your browser, without having to install anything on your computer. The development environment lets you quickly preview your changes, and even commit them to GitHub and create a pull request.

* [Open online dev environment on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.io/github/wokwi/wokwi-docs)
* [Open online dev environment on Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-docs) - requires a GitHub login

## Local Development

You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
Clone this repo to your computer, then install the dependencies:

```console
yarn install
```

Start the local development server:

```console
yarn start
```

This will also open up a browser window with the docs site. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
