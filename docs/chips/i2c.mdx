To create an I2C device, first call `i2c_init`, passing in an `i2c_dev_t` struct.
This struct defines the SCL/SDA pins, the I2C device address, and the connect/read/write/disconnect callbacks.

### `i2c_init`

```cpp
void i2c_init(void *user_ctx, const i2c_dev_t *dev);
```

Initializes an I2C device. The `user_ctx` argument will be passed to your callbacks.
You can use it to pass a pointer to your chip's internal state.
The `dev` argument defines the options for the I2C device. It contains the following fields:

| Field      | Type     | Description                                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| address    | uint32_t | Listen for requests matching the given I2C address (7-bit). To listen for all requests, set to 0 |
| sda        | pin_t    | The SDA pin                                                                                      |
| scl        | pin_t    | The SCL pin                                                                                      |
| connect    | callback | Called when the chip is addressed on the I2C bus                                                 |
| read       | callback | Called when the microcontroller wants to read a byte of data from your chip                      |
| write      | callback | Called when the microcontroller writes a byte to your chip                                       |
| disconnect | callback | Called when the microcontroller disconnects from your chip                                       |

All the callbacks (conenct, read, write, disconnect) are optional. They all get the `user_ctx` pointer as their first argument.

## Usage example

```cpp
bool on_i2c_connect(void *user_ctx, uint32_t address, bool read) {
  // `address` parameter contains the 7-bit address that was received on the I2C bus.
  // `read` indicates whether this is a read request (true) or write request (false).
  return true; // true means ACK, false NACK
}

uint8_t on_i2c_read(void *user_ctx) {
  return 0; // The byte to be returned to the microcontroller
}

bool on_i2c_write(void *user_ctx, uint8_t data) {
  // `data` is the byte received from the microcontroller
  return true; // true means ACK, false NACK
}

void on_i2c_disconnect(void *user_ctx) {
  // This method is optional. Useful if you need to know when the I2C transaction has concluded.
}

static const i2c_dev_t i2c1 {
  .address = 0x22,
  .scl = pin_init("SCL", INPUT_PULLUP),
  .sda = pin_init("SDA", INPUT_PULLUP),
  .connect = on_i2c_connect,
  .read = on_i2c_read,
  .write = on_i2c_write,
  .disconnect = on_i2c_disconnect,
};
```
