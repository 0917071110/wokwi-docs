import { LibraryList } from '@site/src/library-list';

You can use many popular Arduino libraries on Wokwi.

To include a library, go to the code editor and type `#` on an empty line. You'll see a autocomplete dropdown with many `#include` suggestions.
This list includes most of the available libraries, but not all of them.

The complete list of libraries currently available on Wokwi:

## Requesting a library

If you need a library that is not on the list above, you can add the individual source code files from the library to your project.

Alternatively, you can [open an issue and request to add a library](https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-features/issues/new). We'll try
to answer your request within 24 hours. Standard libraries (that are available through the Arduino Library Manager) are easier for
us to add, so you'll usually get faster response.
