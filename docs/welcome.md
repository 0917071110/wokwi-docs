Wokwi is an online Electronics simulator. You can use it to simulate Arduino, ESP32, and many other popular boards, parts and sensors.

Here are some quick examples of things you can make with Wokwi:

- [Blink an LED on ESP32](https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects/305566932847821378)
- [Play music with the Arduino Uno](https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects/291958456169005577)
- [Monitor the weather on ATtiny85](https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects/292900020514980360)
- [Control 32 Servos with Arduino Mega](https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects/305336312628511297)
- [Animate an LED Matrix with FastLED](https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects/320579687608746578)
- [7 Segment Counter with MicroPython on ESP32](https://wokwi.com/arduino/projects/300210834979684872)
