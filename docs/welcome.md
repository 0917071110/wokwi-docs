title: Welcome to Wokwi!

Wokwi is an online simulator for Arduino and Electronics. It's designed for makers, by makers.

You can use Wokwi to learn Arduino programming, prototype your ideas, and share your projects with other makers.

The documentation is still in early stages, and is missing a lot of information. If you need any help, please
hop on our [Discord server](https://wokwi.com/discord), where a bunch of frienly community members are available
to help you.
